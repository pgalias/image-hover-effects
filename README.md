# Image Hover Effects
Pack of effects which plays when user hovers on object. 


It can be used in two ways:

1. CSS - import iheffets.css to your project and use like that `<div class="effect transparency">...</div>`
2. LESS - use .less files to customize effects or import only this effects you need to in your project.
